Over the course of time, 
i've extended my range of knowledge regarding development with java..
And i'm terrified of how terrible my past code seems to me retrospectively.

Being a developer means to me, 
hating your code from only 2 months ago and desiring to rewrite it all,
but not having the motivation to do so..
